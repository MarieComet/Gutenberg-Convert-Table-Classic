Convert <table> in Classic block instead of Table Block (preserve original markup).

Works with the "Convert to blocks" button in articles written in Classic Editor, and when copying text containing tables.


== Why ? ==

Because, for the moment, the table block lacks options (rowspan, etc), and when converting tables, some original formatting is lost.
